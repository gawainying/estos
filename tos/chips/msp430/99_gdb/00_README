This directory has files that makes using gdb easier with the msp430.

So one is debugging the <blah> application located in apps/<blah>.

For the purpose of this tutorial, let's build for the z1 platform.  The
z1 uses a msp430f2617 processor which belongs to the x2 family.  This will
be needed when deciding which cpu specific gdb support file to use.

First one must build the application with debugging information.  This can
be done using either "make debug z1" or "make debugopt z1".  The later is
preferred because it optimizes as well as including debugging information.

Debugging is done via a jtag port connected to a gdb server that implements
the remote gdb protocol.  Older toolchains supplied msp430-jtag for
manipulating the jtag port and msp430-gdbproxy for the gdb server.   The
problem with these older tools is they only handle early TI processors
and are not open source so can not be easily extended for the newer
processors.   These two tools have been replaced by mspdebug which is
open source.  Mspdebug works well for the x5 processors but is somewhat
flakey for the x2.

GDB can execute gdb run commands from the execution directory and your home
directory.  These files are named .gdbinit.  The init file in the build
directory is build/z1/.gdbinit.    But keep in mind that if one does a "make
clean" it wipes out build and everything below it.  So the thing to do is
place the .gdbinit file and friends in the apps/<blah> directory and link
from build/z1.   See below.

CPU dependent gdb command files are also available for the various flavors
of msp430 cpus.   Sourcing one of these files will make available various
commands for looking at different parts of the processor.  They need to be
in apps/<blah> for the same reason as gdbinit.

To set up the application directory, apps/<blah> do the following:
	(assuming in the top level of the tinyos root)

    cd apps/<blah>
    cp ../../tos/chips/msp430/99_gdb/gdbinit ./.gdbinit
    cp ../../tos/chips/msp430/99_gdb/gdb_x2  ./.gdb_x2
    make debugopt z1 && mspdebug uif -qjd /dev/ttyUSB0 --force-reset \
	    \"prog build/z1/main.exe\"

The --force-reset make mspdebug behave better with x2 processors.   Your
mileage may vary.

now that the build directory exists, we can finish preping the gdb files.

    cd build/z1
    ln -s ../../gdbinit

Fire up the gdb server.   Probably from another terminal window.

    mspdebug uif -qjd /dev/ttyUSB0 "opt gdb_loop true" gdb

And connect to the beasty using gdb.   From the apps/<blah> directory:

    msp430-gdb build/z1/main.exe

Emacs also has a nice interface to all of this including a source level
debugging mechanism.  From within emacs use M-x gdb and then

    Run gdb (like this): msp430-gdb --annotate=3 build/z1/main.exe


Slow Debugging:  (from David Brown, <david@westcontrol.com>, thanks David)

By default, gdb considers all memory areas to be non-cached (i.e., it
reads them from the hardware every time it wants to show them) and uses
native sized accesses.  This means that if it wants to read code, such
as to show the disassembly window, it has to do an awful lot of 2-byte
reads from the chip - often reading the same address several times.  As
there is a certain latency for each read, this can mean long delays
while everything is read and re-read (you can see this on the output of
mspdebug).

The way to avoid this is by memory regions.  In the gdb setup, include
several lines about memory:


set remoteaddresssize 64
set remotetimeout 999999
set remote memory-write-packet-size 2048
set remote memory-write-packet-size fixed
set remote memory-read-packet-size 2048
set remote memory-read-packet-size fixed

set mem inaccessible-by-default off
mem 0x2100 0x100000 ro 64 cache


The exact range for the "ro 64 cache" memory area will depend on the
chip you use, but it should cover the code flash.  gdb will then know
that it can use 64-byte reads in this area, and can remember the results
- substantially cutting down on extra reads.
